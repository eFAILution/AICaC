- If weak, pivot to "lessons learned" paper
- Focus on methodology contribution
- Submit to workshop instead of main conference

### Risk: Get Scooped

**Mitigation:**
- Publish arXiv early
- Open source everything
- Build community quickly
- Claim "first empirical validation"

### Risk: Reviewers Reject

**Mitigation:**
- Have backup venues ready
- Address limitations proactively
- Strong reproducibility package
- Clear contribution statement

### Risk: Low Adoption

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on empirical evidence (self-contained)
- Market to developers, not just tools
- Partner with popular projects
- Create converters (AGENTS.md → .ai/)
